Set of vectors S in R4
Vector #1:
[1, 1, 1, 0]
Vector #2:
[-1, 0, -1, 1]
Vector #3:
[-1, 0, 0, -1]

Orthogonal set of vectors T transformed from S using Gran-Schmit
Vector #1:
[1, 1, 1, 0]
Vector #2:
[-0.333333, 0.666667, -0.333333, 1]
Vector #3:
[-0.8, 0.6, 0.2, -0.6]

To obtain orthonormal vectors of T, just multiply the reciprocal of each vector's magnitude to itself!
[ie: (1/|Vi|)*Vi = Ui <--- unit vector of Vi]
Will still calculate if want a refrence...
Vector #1's magnitude: 1.73205
Vector #2's magnitude: 1.29099
Vector #3's magnitude: 1.18322

Orthonormal set of vectors T* (T_new) transformed from T by multiplying each vector's magnitude reciprocal
Vector #1:
[0.57735, 0.57735, 0.57735, 0]
Vector #2:
[-0.258199, 0.516398, -0.258199, 0.774597]
Vector #3:
[-0.676123, 0.507093, 0.169031, -0.507093]
